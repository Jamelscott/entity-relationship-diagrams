## What is an ERD

ERD is an acronym for *ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM*. Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD, ER Diagram or ER model, is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. An ERD contains different symbols and connectors that visualize two important information: The major entities within the system scope, and the inter-relationships among these entities.


## ERD Tools

### [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net) 

![an imbedded draw.io png ERD](./erd.drawio.png)

#### Pros:

* can embed pngs into github repo that update when ERD is updated
* can share ERDs
* can do WAY more that ERDs -- including wireframs, charts, slideshows etc
* can include mix ERDs with other types of visual aids such as text, flowcharts, icons etc
* cannot export SQL commands
* does not use SQL to make ERDs, uses its own scripting langauge which is optional

#### Cons:

* sometimes the UI can be clunky

### [Miro Boads](https://miro.com/)

#### Pros:

* UI is intuitive and responsive
* realtime collaboration with other team members
* one stop shop for everything a team needs such as  kanban boards, brainstorming, SCRUM management
* easily makes nice looking wireframes

#### Cons:

* there is no proper what to make standard SQL ERDs, so tour ERDs look more like a flowchart
* cannot export SDL commands
* cannot export to github repos
* only two boards per unpaid account

### [db.desienger.net](https://app.dbdesigner.net)

![ERD made with db.designer.net](./db.desienger-erd.png)

#### Pros:

* GUI is intuitive
* allows for SQL dialect specific features
* exports raw SQL commands based on schema
* RAW sql can optinally be used to create schema
* supports templates
* allows comments on schema
* allows sharing ERDs

#### Cons:

* only allows two ERDs on an unapid account
* cannot save to/imbed in a gh repo

### [Mermaid Diagrams](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) 

flowchart:

```mermaid
flowchart TD;
  A[1 sqaure];
  B{2 diamond};
  C --> D;
  E[square] -- neat --> F{triangle};
  F(round) --> G{hello \n newline?};
```

pie chart:

```mermaid
pie title pets
    "Dogs" : 386
    "Cats" : 260
    "turtle" : 15
    "rabbit" : 150
```

ERD:

```mermaid
    erDiagram
       DOG { string name }
       DOG {
         int age
         string breed
         string pedigree
       }
       OWNER ||..|{ DOG : owns
       OWNER {

       PROGRAMME }|--|| TRAINER : "operated by"
       DOG ||--|{ PROGRAMME : attends
       PROGRAMME {
         float costPerSession
       }
```

#### Pros:

* built in support on github flavoered markhown
* makes nice charts

#### Cons:

* requires learning the syntax, which can be obtuse
* does support any kind of import/export

### [db diagram.net](https://dbdiagram.io/home/)
